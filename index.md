# About

Hello, I'm a computer science student, currently working as a software developer. I have a passion for solving problems and continuous learning. I love coding and the hands-on nature of computer science really excites me, because I can easily see the results of my work.

I started my university journey as an electrical engineering student, not having seen a single line of code. Working through the compulsory programming courses, I gradually got more and more inclined to this field of study. I started taking optional computer science courses, and finally decided to make CS my major in master's studies. So here I am now.
